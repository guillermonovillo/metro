"<p>The informational material on this site is provided for informational "

"interest in the proposed project based upon a Preliminary Subdivision Public "
"Report issued by the California Bureau of Real Estate (“BRE”). </p><p>The "
"developer has obtained the issuance of a Preliminary Subdivision Public "
"Report from the BRE and is permitted to advertise the project, take "

"However, no binding contracts may be entered into at this time. The "

"financial, tax, accounting, investment, business or legal advice. Oral "
"representations should not be relied upon as correctly stating "
"representations of the developer. </p><p>The developer may not enter into "
"any binding contracts to sell units in the project until after a Conditional "
"Subdivision Public Report has been issued by the BRE. The BRE review of the "
"developer’s application and required filing materials includes, but is not "
"limited to, the terms and conditions of the proposed offering, the condition "
"of title, the status of blanket liens on the project, security arrangements "
"to assure project completion, access from public streets, the availability "
"of sufficient water service, utilities, public schools and other public "
"services and improvements for the proposed development, and acceptable "
"documents and provisions for establishment of one or more owners’ "
"associations to manage and operate the project. </p><p>The complete offering "
"terms will be made available to prospective buyers by the developer and its "
"real estate brokers when such offering terms and conditions have been "
"finalized and have been authorized by the BRE to be used for entering into "
"purchase agreements. Purchasers should obtain a copy of the Conditional or "
"Final Subdivision Public Report, when available, for additional information "
"about the project. No federal agency has judged the merits or value, if any, "
"of this project. </p><p>The diagrams and drawings of the proposed project on "

"reserves the right to make such modifications, revisions, and changes in the "
"design of the project and the buildings and condominium units therein, that "
"it deems desirable in its sole and absolute discretion or as may be required "
"by law or governmental bodies. All features, specifications and plans are "
"subject to change without notice. Dimensions and square footages are "
"approximate only, based upon initial architectural drawings, and may vary "
"with actual construction of the project and redesign of the size, "
"orientation and locations of the units and other building elements. </"
"p><p>Any views represented in the materials on this site are also "

"depending on conditions such as location, skyline, and weather. Prospective "
"purchasers should be aware that any view from the unit and the remainder of "
"the project may in the future be limited or eliminated by construction of "
"buildings on adjacent or neighboring properties. Developer hereby gives "
"notice to prospective purchasers that developer in no manner guarantees the "
"continuing existence of any view from any particular unit in the project. "
"Further, developer gives notice to prospective purchasers that the developer "

"included with the unit unless otherwise provided by developer in the "

"access to particular recreational or other amenities in the project, will "
