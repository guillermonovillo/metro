               <h1>Downtown LA Development Boom Pits Condos Against Hotels</h1>
               <h3>Patrick Healy <time>May 21, 2014</time></h3>
               <div class="press-image-related">
                  <img class="img" src="../images/press/img/1. Downtown LA Development Boom Pits Condos Against Hotels.jpg" alt="Downtown LA Development Boom Pits Condos Against Hotels" />
               </div>

<p>Condos are king in downtown Los Angeles' resurgent building boom, but it's hotel space that City Hall and the tourism industry are trying to persuade developers to build.</p>
<p>A series of mixed-use mega developments are in the pipeline, including the Grand Avenue Project near the Music Center, and Metropolis at the south end of Bunker Hill near LA Live.</p>
<p>Condominium buildings are the preference for developers looking to maximize investment return. But they are being urged to include hotels, with the belief that adding more rooms is essential for Los Angeles to land more convention business.</p>
<p>"We want more hotels. We're incentivizing hotels," said LA City Councilman Jose Huizar, whose 14th district includes downtown.</p>
<p>Officials from the Los Angeles Tourism &amp; Convention Board estimate the city needs another 2,000 to 3,000 more hotel rooms within walking distance of the Convention Center. There is also a consensus that the aging Convention Center itself needs updating to make it more competitive with facilities in other cities. The West Hall was to be razed and replaced as part of the city's agreement permitting AEG to build the proposed Farmers Field football stadium. City officials, including Huizar, favor a "Plan B" for re-doing West Hall, even if AEG is unable to line up an NFL team before the Farmers Field agreement expires in the fall.</p>
<p>"The convention center is central to everything downtown," said Horacio LeDon, with the Douglas Elliman firm handling condominium sales for Metropolis.</p>
<p>Metropolis is poised to become downtown's next mega development, with construction scheduled to begin within a month on six acres between Eighth and Ninth streets. The first of two phases</p>
<p>will include two towers, one dedicated to condominiums, the other intended to be a four-star hotel with a flagship brand to be announced shortly.</p>
<p>"They were willing to include the hotel, even though it's not as profitable,"said Huizar.</p>
<p>Hotel developers can apply for incentives, including the city waiving occupancy taxes. The decision is based on a study to determine if waiving the tax is essential to the economic viability of the project. In the case of the hotel in Metropolis, the decision is yet to be made, Huizar said.</p>
<p>The types of towers that will compromise the second phase of Metropolis, LeDon said, has not been determined. Huizar expects that both will be condominiums.</p>
<p>"Condo and high-rise living is something that's totally in demand," said LeDon. Most of the units in the first phase condo tower will be 1 to 2 bedrooms, he said, with some studios priced in their $400,000 range. Top-end units will be in the $4 million range.</p>
<p>A prominent feature of the design is an elevated outdoor concourse, or "podium," to serve as a commons 60 feet above ground level. </p>
<p>The Metropolis "city within a city" was first envisioned a quarter century ago. Even though the project obtained all required approvals to proceed, the plan remained stalled until the property was acquired in the past year by the American subsidiary of Greenland Holding Group, a China-based firm focused primarily on real estate development.</p>
<p>The city expedited review of modifications since the project was revived, and earlier this month, on May 14, the the Advisory Agency to LA's Planning Department issued a "Letter of Determination" enabling the project to proceed, according to Deputy Director Lisa Webber.</p>
<p>Douglas Elliman, the New York-based luxury real estate firm that only recently established a West Coast presence with an office in Beverly Hills, was ready to jump on the news. It had prepared a slick, 290-page magazine with an artist's conception of Metropolis on the cover, included as an insert with the Los Angeles Times newspaper in many of its home delivery areas</p>
<p>The Metropolis location has become even more valuable since the opening of LA Live. The</p>
<p>two developments will be connected by one block of Francisco Street along which Marriott is preparing to open a Residence Inn and a Courtyard by Marriott in the same newly constructed high-rise. The effect is to create an expanded entertainment district, LeDon said. </p>
<p>Besides restaurants, clubs, and theaters, LA Live includes two hotels; a JW Marriott and a Ritz Carlton, along with condominiums, in adjoining buildings.</p>
<p>Another long-delayed project, Fig Central across Figueroa Street from Staples Center, is expected to be revived under the new ownership of Beijing-based Oceanwide Real Estate.</p>
<p>Huizar and LeDon are not alone in crediting AEG with getting the ball rolling for major projects south of the Bunker Hill office tower district.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for for Staples Center and LA Live/Ritz Carlton, I don't know if we would be here," LeDon said. "I think AEG was the catalyst for everything big."</p>
<p>"The future of downtown is really entertainment. It's more residences," Huizar said.</p>

               <p>The speed at which Ifei Chang, 49, assumed her position as president and chief executive officer of Greenland U.S. Holding and her equally swift investment in two multibillion-dollar deals demonstrate the pace at which Chinese companies are committing to large-scale construction outside their homeland.</p>

<p>The informational material on this site is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offering of condominium units for sale or for solicitation of offers to purchase units. It is to help generate interest in the proposed project based upon a Preliminary Subdivision Public Report issued by the California Bureau of Real Estate (“BRE”). </p>

<p>The developer has obtained the issuance of a Preliminary Subdivision Public Report from the BRE and is permitted to advertise the project, take reservations and receive refundable deposits from prospective buyers. However, no binding contracts may be entered into at this time. The materials and information on this site should in no way be relied upon for financial, tax, accounting, investment, business or legal advice. Oral representations should not be relied upon as correctly stating representations of the developer. </p>

<p>The developer may not enter into any binding contracts to sell units in the project until after a Conditional Subdivision Public Report has been issued by the BRE. The BRE review of the developer’s application and required filing materials includes, but is not limited to, the terms and conditions of the proposed offering, the condition of title, the status of blanket liens on the project, security arrangements to assure project completion, access from public streets, the availability of sufficient water service, utilities, public schools and other public services and improvements for the proposed development, and acceptable documents and provisions for establishment of one or more owners’ associations to manage and operate the project. </p>

<p>The complete offering terms will be made available to prospective buyers by the developer and its real estate brokers when such offering terms and conditions have been finalized and have been authorized by the BRE to be used for entering into purchase agreements. Purchasers should obtain a copy of the Conditional or Final Subdivision Public Report, when available, for additional information about the project.

Prospective purchasers should be aware that any view from the unit and the remainder of the project may in the future be limited or eliminated by construction of buildings on adjacent or neighboring properties. Developer hereby gives notice to prospective purchasers that developer in no manner guarantees the continuing existence of any view from any particular unit in the project. Further, developer gives notice to prospective purchasers that the developer makes no commitment or representation concerning the development of any property in proximity to, or visible from, the unit or project. </p>
