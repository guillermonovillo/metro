<p>One of Shanghai’s leading developers, Greenland Group, is set to debut in the United States after announcing construction of the USD1 billion Metropolis Los Angeles project as part of the group’s international expansion.</p>

<p>The mixed-use development on Francisco Street, between 8th and 9th Streets in Downtown Los Angeles, aims to reshape the West Coast’s real estate landscape when it is completed by mid-2016, according to <i>China Daily USA</i>.</p>

<p>“We believe Los Angeles’ location as a gateway between Asia and North America is ideal in attracting an international clientele who are seeking investment opportunities and an exciting lifestyle near arts and entertainment, sports and fine dining,” said Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Group.</p>

<p>The Gensler-designed development will comprise a four-star luxury hotel with 350 guest rooms and a high-end 38-storey residential tower offering studios to two-bedroom units. Construction will begin in the first half of 2014 under Tishman Construction and Turner Construction, whilst interiors will be designed by SPAN Architecture.</p>

<p>Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles welcomed the project, noting that “this billion-dollar investment will not only bolster Downtown Los Angeles’ economy by creating hundreds of jobs and generating on-going tax revenue, but it will bring the kind of world-class amenities that will enhance the appeal of our city center nationally and internationally.”</p>
