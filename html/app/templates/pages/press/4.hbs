               <p>Friday's <a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/how_pouring.php">record-setting pour</a> at Wilshire Grand wasn't the only big news downtown this weekend. The groundbreaking for the long-awaited Metropolis development was a lot more exciting than shovels in the dirt because it also included a big reveal of never-before seen conceptual renderings and models. So many of downtown's <a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2014/02/see_5oh_the_two_towers_planned_for_park_fifths_vacant_spot.php">notoriously halted</a> projects have been in the news recently because they're no longer stalled. Big development is moving forward in downtown, often times because of foreign investment, as is the case with Gensler-designed <a href="http://la.curbed.com/places/metropolis">Metropolis</a>, which is backed by the Chinese group Greenland USA. The <a href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2014/01/downtowns_huge_metropolis_project_could_start_next_month.php">first phase</a> of development at Metropolis will see two high-rises--a residential tower and 19-story fancy hotel--join the skyline; no word on when you'll be able to move into the residential units (also undecided: whether they'll be condos or apartments), but Brigham Yen over at DTLA Rising <href="#more-11856">says</a> the hotel is planning to open in February 2016.</p>
